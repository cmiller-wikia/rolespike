# rolespike

Simple CRUD Service (based on my suggested API for the roles service). Not for production use.

Currently only runs on an in-memory database.

## All the instructions you need

```sbt test```

```sbt run```

## Notes

Application code is in 'fandom.roles'. Non-service-specific supporting code is in the 'fandom' package.
